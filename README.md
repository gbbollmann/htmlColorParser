# htmlColorParser
Simple Javascript project to receive an input text string and parse it to hex color

I got this idea when looking at a StackOverflow thread where the user asked why when you define a bgcolor css style and put the value of "chucknorris" the browser renders a dark red color.

It is actualy a function present in browsers, as explained by this post "A little rant about Microsoft Internet Explorer's color parsing", available here:

I wanted to create that function myself using JS.

It is NOT the most efficient code in the world, but does what I want it to do.

Enjoy!
